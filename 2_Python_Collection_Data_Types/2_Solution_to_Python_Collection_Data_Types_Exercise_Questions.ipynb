    "## 1. The output of running this code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_1 = []     # initialize an empty list\n",
    "for item in range(3):\n",
    "    list_1[item].append(item)  # this will raise an error because list_1 is empty\n",
    "print(item)    # print the last value of item in the loop\n",
    "print(list_1)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The code will raise an `IndexError` because we are trying to access an index of `list_1` that does not exist (it is empty). When `item` is `0`, it tries to execute `list_1[0].append(0)`, but `list_1` has no elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Accessing Index 10 in a `list` or `tuple`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(numbers[10])  # this will raise an IndexError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- Attempting to access index `10` in the list `numbers` will raise an `IndexError` because valid indices are `0` to `9` for a list of size `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. `tuple` Conversion\n",
    "```python\n",
    "original_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "temp_list = list(original_tuple)  # tuple to list\n",
    "\n",
    "temp_list.append(6)  # add an item to the end of the list\n",
    "temp_list.append(7)  # add an item to the end of the list \n",
    "\n",
    "final_tuple = tuple(temp_list)   # list to tuple\n",
    "print(final_tuple)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- After converting the tuple to a list and adding two items, converting it back results in `final_tuple` containing `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Modifying a `tuple`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "# my_tuple[2] = 35  # this will raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "# modify tuple contents\n",
    "temp_list = list(my_tuple)         # convert to a list\n",
    "temp_list[2] = 35                  # modify it\n",
    "modified_tuple = tuple(temp_list)  # modify back to a tuple\n",
    "print(modified_tuple)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- Attempting to directly change an element of a `tuple` will raise a `TypeError`. The proper method is to convert it to a `list`, modify the `list`, and then convert it back to a `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Reversing a String and Slicing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "str_a = \"Python is fun!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "reversed_str = str_a[::-1]       # reverse it using slicing\n",
    "sliced_str = reversed_str[3:9]   # extract from the 4th to the 8th position (inclusive)\n",
    "print(sliced_str)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The reversed string is `\"!nuf si nohtyP\"`, and extracting characters from index `3` to `8` gives `\"nuf si\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. `range` and `list` Modification\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num_range = range(5, 26, 3)  # output 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23\n",
    "\n",
    "num_list = list(num_range)   # range to a list\n",
    "\n",
    "num_list[4] = 100            # changing the 4th item\n",
    "print(num_list)  \n",
    "\n",
    "# try changing directly in the range\n",
    "# num_range[4] = 100  # this raises a TypeError because ranges are immutable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- Modifying an item in the converted `list` works, but trying to modify an item directly in the `range` will raise a `TypeError` since ranges are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Generating a Sequence and Summing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "seq_range = range(0, 101, 10)\n",
    "seq_list = list(seq_range)  # convert range into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "total_sum = sum(seq_list)   # sum it up\n",
    "print(total_sum)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The sequence generated will be `[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]`, and the sum of these elements will be `550`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Cumulative Sum of Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sales = [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400]  # weekly sales\n",
    "\n",
    "cumsum_sales = []        # initialize an empty list for cumulative sums\n",
    "current_sum = 0          # initialize current sum\n",
    "\n",
    "for sale in sales:       # loop through each sale\n",
    "    current_sum += sale  # add current sale to current sum\n",
    "    cumsum_sales.append(current_sum)  # append the cumulative sum to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "print(cumsum_sales)  # output: [100, 250, 450, 700, 1000, 1350, 1750]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1. Additional challenge: Running Average Calculation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "running_avg_sales = []    # initialize an empty list for running averages\n",
    "total_sum = 0             # initialize total sum\n",
    "\n",
    "for index, sale in enumerate(sales):  # loop through each sale with index\n",
    "    total_sum += sale                 # add current sale to total sum\n",
    "    running_average = total_sum / (index + 1)  # calculate running average\n",
    "    running_avg_sales.append(running_average)  # append to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "print(running_avg_sales)  # output: [100.0, 125.0, 150.0, 175.0, 200.0, 225.0, 250.0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The running average is calculated by dividing the cumulative total by the number of days (using the index) and storing it in `running_avg_sales`. Remember that the index starts from `0`; hence, we need the `index + 1` to account for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Swapping Keys and Values in a Dictionary\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alphabet_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "swapped_dict = {value: key for key, value in alphabet_dict.items()}  # swap key, value\n",
    "print(swapped_dict)  # output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c', 4: 'd', 5: 'e'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The code creates a new dictionary `swapped_dict` by swapping the keys and values from `alphabet_dict` using dictionary comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Average Sales Calculation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "weekly_sales = [200, 300, 250, 400, 350, 380, 420]\n",

    "## 11. Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation of Stock Prices\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "stock_prices = [100, 102, 98, 105, 107, 106, 103, 110, 108, 107]\n",
    "mean_price = sum(stock_prices) / len(stock_prices)\n",

    "std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)  \n",
    "\n",
    "print(f'Sample Standard Deviation of Stock Prices: {std_deviation}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- The sample standard deviation is calculated using the formula provided. First, we compute the mean of the stock prices. Then, we calculate the variance using list comprehension to find the squared differences from the mean, summing them up, and dividing by `n-1` (degrees of freedom). Finally, we take the square root of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Set Operations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define two sets\n",
    "set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\n",

    "frozen_numbers = frozenset(numbers)  # list to frozenset\n",
    "\n",
    "frozen_numbers.add(60)               # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- A `frozenset` is an immutable version of a `set`. When attempting to add a new number, an `AttributeError` occurs because `frozensets` do not support modification after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. Comparing Stock Prices of Two Companies\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prices_A = [100, 102, 98, 105, 107, 106, 103, 110, 108, 107]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "- This snippet uses list comprehension to find the indices (days) where the stock price of company B is higher than that of company A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. Squaring Odd Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = list(range(1, 51))  # list of numbers 1, 2, ..., 50\n",
